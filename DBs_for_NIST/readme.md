### FILES FOR NIST

These files (in .msp format) are in NIST-style and compatible with NISTMS and any other software that reads and understand these files. Further they contain the retention index stored within the file.
The folder structures are generated with the LIB2NIST library converter tool (https://chemdata.nist.gov/mass-spc/ms-search/Library_conversion_tool.html) and zipped for more convenience. 
Please download the msp or download and unzip the zip and copy the file(s) into the required folder (typically C:\NISTMS)
